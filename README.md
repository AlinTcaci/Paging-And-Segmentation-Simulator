# Paging and Segmentation Simulator

## Overview
The Paging and Segmentation Simulator project is designed to be an educational tool that demonstrates the concepts of paging and segmentation, which are crucial memory management techniques in computer operating systems. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interactively simulate and visualize how paging and segmentation work in managing system memory. The simulator aims to make complex concepts in operating system design more accessible and understandable, particularly for students and educators in computer science.

## Features

- **Simulation of Paging and Segmentation:** Users can understand and visualize how paging and segmentation work in managing memory, including the allocation and mapping processes.

- **Interactive User Interface:** The simulator includes a GUI for both paging and segmentation, allowing users to create and modify memory segments, manage fixed-size pages, and simulate address translations.

- **Real-Time Memory Visualization:** Provides graphical representation of memory, showcasing how pages and segments are allocated and mapped in real-time.

- **Error Handling:** Simulates real-world scenarios by raising errors for invalid addresses, simulating segmentation faults, and handling page faults.

## Usage

1. **Select Memory Management Technique:** Upon launching the simulator, choose between paging and segmentation to start the simulation.

2. **Configure Memory Settings:** Set the memory size and OS size as required by the simulation.

3. **Create Processes/Segments:** For paging, create processes and pages. For segmentation, define and modify segments with unique names and corresponding values.

4. **Visualization and Interaction:** Use the GUI to visualize the memory allocation and mapping. Interact with the simulation to allocate memory, create segments/pages, and simulate address translation.

## Design

The Paging and Segmentation Simulator is implemented in Java, utilizing Swing for the GUI components. The simulator separates the logic for paging and segmentation into distinct modules, each handling the specific details of its memory management technique.

- **Memory Management Techniques:** Implements algorithms for managing memory using paging and segmentation, including memory allocation, deallocation, and address translation.
- **GUI:** The interface provides users with interactive elements to control the simulation, including buttons, text fields, and visualization panels.

### Key Classes

- `PagingMemoryGUI`: Simulates paging memory management technique.
- `SegmentationMemoryGUI`: Simulates segmentation memory management technique.
- `Process` and `Segments` classes: Used for creating and managing pages and segments in memory.

## Testing and Validation

Users are encouraged to test the simulator by creating processes or segments, simulating memory management, and observing how the simulator handles various scenarios, including invalid addresses and page faults.

## Future Development

Introducing more advanced memory management techniques and scenarios, including demand paging, page replacement algorithms, and segmentation with paging.

## Conclusions

This simulator offers a user-friendly and task-focused GUI, making it an effective educational tool for understanding and learning about paging and segmentation memory management techniques.
